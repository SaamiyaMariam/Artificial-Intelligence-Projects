# Genetic Algorithm for N-Queens Problem

## Introduction:
This repository contains a Python script (`main.py`) that implements a genetic algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem is a classic chessboard puzzle where N queens must be placed on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

## How to Use:
1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Input the board size when prompted.
3. The script generates a population of board configurations with queens placed randomly.
4. It evaluates the fitness of each configuration based on the number of attacking queens.
5. The script then performs crossover (cross-breeding) between pairs of configurations to create a new generation.
6. The new generation is evaluated for fitness, and the process continues for several generations.
