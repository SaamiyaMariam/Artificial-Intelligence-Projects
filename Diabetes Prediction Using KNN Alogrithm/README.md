# KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) to Predict Diabetes

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook (`knn_main.ipynb`). The KNN algorithm is a simple and versatile machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

## Contents

- **KNN Implementation**: The Jupyter Notebook (`knn_main.ipynb`) contains the implementation of the KNN algorithm. It includes functions for calculating Euclidean distance, finding k-nearest neighbors, predicting classes, and assessing accuracy.

- **Usage Example**: The notebook provides a usage example of the implemented KNN algorithm on a sample dataset. It demonstrates how to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate its accuracy.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`knn_main.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment.
2. Follow the provided code and explanations to understand the KNN algorithm implementation.
3. Execute the code cells to run the KNN algorithm on a sample dataset.
4. Explore and modify the notebook for your own datasets and parameters.

Feel free to experiment with different values of k and datasets to observe the behavior and performance of the KNN algorithm.

## Dependencies

The implementation relies on common Python libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`. Ensure these libraries are installed in your environment before running the notebook.

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
