# N-Queens Backtracking

## Introduction:
This repository contains a Python script (`main.py`) that solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem is a classic chessboard puzzle where N queens must be placed on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

## How to Use:
1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. The script initializes a chessboard with random queen placements.
3. It attempts to solve the N-Queens problem using backtracking.
4. The final state, if found, will be displayed as a solution.
5. If no solution is found, a failure message will be printed.
