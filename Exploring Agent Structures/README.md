# The Vacuum World - Exploring Agent Structures

## Overview:
This project provides insights into the design of agent programs using the example of a vacuum agent in a two-state environment. Explore various agent programs and understand their decision-making processes based on percepts.

## How to Run the Code:
1. Execute the cells in the Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` sequentially.
2. Ensure the existence of the `agents_modules.py` module for agent-related functions.
3. Adjust environment and agent configurations as needed.
4. Experiment with different agent programs and observe their behavior.
