# 8-Puzzle Solver

## Overview:
This repository contains a Python script (`main.py`) that implements a solver for the 8-puzzle problem using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDFS). The 8-puzzle is a classic problem in artificial intelligence where a 3x3 grid contains numbered tiles, and the goal is to arrange the tiles in ascending order.

## How to Use:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Run the `main.py` script.
3. The script initializes the puzzle with a start state and a goal state.
4. It performs DFS and IDFS to solve the puzzle, displaying each move.
